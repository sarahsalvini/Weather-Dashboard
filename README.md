<h1>Week 6 Homework: Server-Side APIs- Weather Dashboard</h1>
Our week 6 homework assignment was to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.
I used the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data for cities.



<h2>Criteria:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>weather dashboard with form inputs</li>
  <li>search for a city</li>
  <li>current and future weather conditions</li>
  <li>add that city to the search history</li>
  <li>view current cities weather conditions</li>
  <li>presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index</li>
  <li>presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe</li>
  <li>5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity</li>
